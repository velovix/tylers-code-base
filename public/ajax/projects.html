<h2>Paunch</h2>

<p>
	Paunch is a game library written in Go and C++. I'm writing it primarily
	for my own use later on, but it's written with the intent that it'd be
	usable as a general 2D game engine. The Go code can be found on my Github
	<a href="http://github.com/velovix/paunch">here</a> and the C++ code is
	<a href="http://github.com/velovix/paunch-cpp">here!</a>
</p>

<h2>Super Glitch Engine</h2>

<p>
	Super Glitch Engine is a recoding of the original Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow
	games in c. It also includes a variety of tools for modifying various
	aspects of the game. It has it's own section on my site! The code can be
	found <a href="http://github.com/velovix/paunch">here.</a>

<h2>Team Tyro</h2>

<p>
	The Team Tyro Research Project is/was a study on how the human brain learns,
	and how human learning relates to the problem solving strategies of basic
	machine intelligence. Our research period is over, but you can still
	partake in the simple learning test on the Team Tyro Website!
</p>

<p>
	I worked on the test itself, which takes the form of a web-embedded Java
	applet. The test may seem very simple, and it is. Most of the work went
	into the backend (recording data, analysis, working with the database,
	etc).
