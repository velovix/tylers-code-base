	Trinosaurs is a game I'm working on with a talented friend of mine. It's a
	game where you play three dinosaurs on a rampage against evil adversaries.
	Trinosaurs is a bit hard to explain, but it's a little like a Life
	Force-esqe shooting game mixed with a healthy helping of craziness. Photos
	and/or videos will hopefully be released soon.
