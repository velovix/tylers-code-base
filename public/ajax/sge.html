<p>
	Super Glitch Engine is a project that aims to completely recode the classic
	Pokemon Red/Yellow/Blue games. The completed project will have every
	feature from the original games, to the point where the original game could
	be created on SGE.
</p>

<p>
	SGE also has a variety of graphical menus that allow the user to customize
	nearly every aspect of the game, or even create an entirely new one! Only a
	few key components won't be changeable without editing the source: the
	grid-based overworld environment and the basics of the turn-based battle
	system.
</p>

<p>
	That being said, SGE hasn't been worked on in a good few months, mostly
	because I'm regretting a lot of design decisions I made early on. I may
	continue work on SGE in the future, but not before going back and making
	a lot of changes. If I started working on it again, I would probably use
	Paunch, which didn't exist when I did SGE originally.
