	I'm Tyler Compton, a software development enthusiast. I'm fascinated with
	many aspects of computer science, including traditional computer
	programming, development on integrated machines, the creation of mobile
	apps, and web development.
</p>

<p>
	I also have a passion for video game development. I've been entertained and
	fascinated with games since I was just barely reading, and I've been
	working at developing my own since 6th grade.

	Here at my site, you can find information on the various
	projects I've worked on.
