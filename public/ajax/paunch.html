<h2>Paunch</h2>

<p>
	Paunch is a game library written in Go and C++. I'm writing it primarily
	for my own use later on, but it's written with the intent that it'd be
	usable as a general 2D game engine. The Go code can be found on my Github
	<a href="http://github.com/velovix/paunch">here</a> and the C++ code is
	<a href="http://github.com/velovix/paunch-cpp">here!</a>
</p>

<p>
	In the future, the C++ implementation of Paunch will be primarily
	supported, but I may update the Go implementation sometime in the future.
</p>

<p>
	Paunch's power comes from it's simplicity. I've tried to put power in the
	hands of the user when needed, and automate the rest. The following code
	opens a new window in C++.
</p>


<div class="code">
	#include &#60;paunch.h&#62;<br />
	<br />
	int main() {
	<div class="tabbed">
		paunch::Window window(640, 480, 640, 480, false, "Test Window");<br />
		<br />
		window.Open();<br />
		<br />
		while(!window.ShouldClose()) {<br />
		<div class="tabbed">
			window.UpdateEvent();<br />
		</div>
		}<br />
	</div>
	}
</div>
