<h2>Paunch</h2>

<p>
	Paunch is a game library written in Go. I'm writing it primarily for my own
	use later on, but it's written with the intent that it'd be usable as a
	general 2D game engine. The Go code can be found on my Github
	<a href="http://github.com/velovix/paunch">here!</a>
</p>

<p>
	Paunch's power comes from it's simplicity. I've tried to put power in the
	hands of the user when needed, and automate the rest. The following code
	opens a new window.
</p>

<div class="code">
	import "github.com/velovix/paunch"<br />
	<br />
	func main() {
	<div class="tabbed">
		paunch.SetWindowSize(960, 540)<br />
		paunch.SetWindowTitle("Trinosaurs")<br />
		<br />
		paunch.Start()<br />
		<br />
		for !paunch.ShouldClose() {<br />
		<div class="tabbed">
			paunch.UpdateEvents()<br />
		</div>
		}<br />
	</div>
	}
</div>

<p>
	The <a href="/docs?page=paunch">Paunch User Guide</a> goes into much more
	detail about how you can use Paunch for your project. If you're interested,
	please check it out!
</p>

<p>
	There also exists an unfinished C++ implementation found
	<a href="http://github.com/velovix/paunch-cpp">here</a>,
	but it mostly exists for experimentation purposes. It may be buggy or
	unstable, so I would not recommend using it as anything but a base for your
	own development.
